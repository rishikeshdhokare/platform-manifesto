## 🎯 1. Philosophy

Developer experience is a force multiplier. An engineer who can go from zero to running code locally in under an hour, get a PR reviewed in under a day, and deploy to production confidently in under 15 minutes is more effective than one wrestling with environment setup and opaque tooling.

**Our DX goal:** Every engineer, on their first week, should be able to run any service locally, submit a PR, and watch it go to production - with no hand-holding.

---

## 🎯 2. Onboarding Target

A new engineer must be able to reach these milestones independently:

| Milestone | Target Time |
|-----------|------------|
| Laptop setup complete, first PR opened and merged, local service running | End of Week 1 |
| First feature PR merged, attend sprint ceremonies, complete security orientation (see [security-operations.md](../04-infrastructure-and-cloud/10-security-operations.md)) | End of Week 2 |
| First feature deployed to production | End of Week 2 |
| On-call shadow shift completed (pair with primary on-call), domain deep-dive with tech lead, attend architecture clinic | End of Week 3 |
| Solo on-call eligible (added to PagerDuty rotation), buddy graduation (feedback form), 30-day check-in with EM | End of Week 4 |

If these targets are not met, it is a **platform problem**, not an engineer problem. For the detailed new joiner checklist, see [`ONBOARDING.md`](../ONBOARDING.md).

## 💻 3. Local Development

### 3.1 Prerequisites

Local setup must be **repeatable per supported runtime**. The snippets below use the **Java reference implementation** (Corretto, Gradle); other runtimes follow the same contract (pinned version, wrapper or lockfile, `docker compose` for dependencies). See [Local Development](./10-local-development.md) for a runtime matrix.

| Runtime | Reference toolchain (examples) |
|---------|----------------------------------|
| **Java** (reference) | SDKMAN + Amazon Corretto 21, Gradle wrapper in repo |
| Node.js | nvm, fnm, or asdf + npm/pnpm lockfile |
| Go | Official SDK or brew; `go.mod` for versions |
| Python | pyenv, uv, or asdf + pinned dependencies |

The platform provides a `setup.sh` script that installs all required tools on a fresh macOS or Ubuntu machine:

```bash
curl -s https://platform.{company}.internal/setup.sh | bash
```

This installs (Java reference path; other runtimes use their own bootstrap documented per template):
- SDKMAN + Amazon Corretto 21
- Docker Desktop
- Gradle (via wrapper in each Java service repo)
- AWS CLI v2 + SSO configuration
- `kubectl` + `kubectx` + `kubens`
- `helm`
- `argocd` CLI
- `gh` (GitHub CLI)
- `pre-commit` (Git hooks)
- LocalStack CLI

### 3.2 Running a Service Locally

Every service follows the same **pattern**: clone, start dependencies with Docker Compose, run with the local profile. The commands below are the **Java / Spring Boot reference implementation** (`./gradlew bootRun`); Node, Go, and other services use their repo's documented entrypoint (for example `npm run dev`, `make run`).

```bash
# Clone the repo
gh repo clone {company}/orders-service
cd orders-service

# Start all dependencies (Postgres, Redis, Kafka via Docker Compose)
docker compose up -d

# Run the service (Java reference)
./gradlew bootRun --args='--spring.profiles.active=local'
```

This should work. If it doesn't, it's a bug in the service's developer setup.

### 3.3 Docker Compose Standard

Every service ships a `docker-compose.yml` at the repo root that starts all its dependencies:

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
version: '3.8'
services:
  postgres:
    image: postgres:16-alpine
    ports: ["5432:5432"]
    environment:
      POSTGRES_DB: orders
      POSTGRES_USER: orders_user
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: local_password
    volumes:
      - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data

  redis:
    image: redis:7-alpine
    ports: ["6379:6379"]

  kafka:
    image: confluentinc/cp-kafka:7.6.0
    ports: ["9092:9092"]
    environment:
      KAFKA_PROCESS_ROLES: broker,controller
      KAFKA_NODE_ID: 1
      KAFKA_LISTENERS: PLAINTEXT://:9092,CONTROLLER://:9093
      KAFKA_ADVERTISED_LISTENERS: PLAINTEXT://localhost:9092
      KAFKA_CONTROLLER_QUORUM_VOTERS: 1@kafka:9093
      CLUSTER_ID: "local-cluster-id"

volumes:
  postgres_data:
```

### 3.4 Application Local Profile

**Reference implementation (Spring Boot):** `application-local.yml` configures the service to use local Docker dependencies and disables cloud integrations. Other frameworks use equivalent local config files or env files with the same intent.

```yaml
spring:
  datasource:
    url: jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/orders
    username: orders_user
    password: local_password
  kafka:
    bootstrap-servers: localhost:9092

# Use LocalStack for AWS services in local dev
aws:
  endpoint-override: http://localhost:4566
  region: eu-west-1

# Feature flags in offline mode locally
launchdarkly:
  offline: true
  default-flags:
    fulfillment-ml-model-release: false
```

### 3.5 AWS Services Locally - LocalStack

For services that use S3, SQS, Secrets Manager, etc., use **LocalStack**:

```bash
# Start LocalStack
localstack start -d

# Create local S3 bucket (from service's local-setup.sh)
awslocal s3 mb s3://{company}-orders-documents
```

Each service's `local-setup.sh` script provisions all required local AWS resources.

---

## 🛤️ 4. Git Hooks (pre-commit)

Every repository ships with a `.pre-commit-config.yaml` that runs lightweight checks before commit:

```yaml
repos:
- repo: https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks
  rev: v8.18.0
  hooks:
  - id: gitleaks           # Secret detection before commit

- repo: local
  hooks:
  - id: checkstyle
    name: Checkstyle (Java reference)
    entry: ./gradlew checkstyleMain --quiet
    language: system
    pass_filenames: false

  - id: commitlint
    name: Conventional Commits lint
    entry: npx commitlint --edit
    language: node
    stages: [commit-msg]
```

Install hooks: `pre-commit install --hook-type commit-msg`

---

## 💻 5. IDE Setup

### 5.1 Recommended IDE: IntelliJ IDEA (Java reference)

For **Java services**, IntelliJ IDEA is the **reference implementation**: the platform provides a shared settings bundle with Google Java Style, run configurations, Checkstyle, and SonarLint. Teams on other runtimes use VS Code, Cursor, or Neovim with the linter and formatter their stack standardizes (ESLint, golangci-lint, Ruff, etc.).

Import (Java): `File → Manage IDE Settings → Import Settings → platform-ide-settings.zip`

### 5.2 Required Plugins

| Plugin | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **Checkstyle-IDEA** | Inline style violations (Java reference) |
| **SonarLint** | Inline security and quality issues |
| **EnvFile** | Load `.env.local` for run configurations |
| **AWS Toolkit** | AWS resource browsing and Lambda testing |
| **OpenAPI (Swagger) Editor** | Spec validation and preview |

---

## 🛤️ 6. Service Scaffolding - Golden Path Template

New services are created using the Backstage service template - not by copying an existing service. Use the template that matches your runtime; **Java Microservice** is the **reference implementation** documented here.

```
Backstage → Create → Java Microservice Template
```

The Java template generates:
- GitHub repository with correct branch protection rules
- Standard project structure (hexagonal architecture)
- Pre-configured `build.gradle` with platform BOM
- `docker-compose.yml` and `application-local.yml`
- GitHub Actions workflows (CI pipeline)
- ArgoCD application manifest (in platform-config)
- `catalog-info.yaml` (Backstage registration)
- Standard `logback-spring.xml`
- ArchUnit test class
- README template

From template creation to running locally: **< 15 minutes**.

---

## 🏗️ 7. Platform BOM (Bill of Materials)

**Reference implementation (Java / Gradle):** services on the JVM import the **platform BOM**, which pins dependency versions. Teams never specify versions for platform-managed dependencies. Other runtimes use an equivalent lockfile or BOM (npm `package-lock.json` with internal registry constraints, Go workspace modules, Poetry/uv constraints, etc.) as defined by Platform.

```kotlin
// build.gradle.kts
dependencies {
    implementation(platform("com.{company}:platform-bom:2026.01"))

    // No versions needed - managed by the BOM
    implementation("org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web")
    implementation("org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-actuator")
    implementation("io.micrometer:micrometer-registry-prometheus")
    implementation("org.springframework.kafka:spring-kafka")
    implementation("io.opentelemetry:opentelemetry-api")

    testImplementation("org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-test")
    testImplementation("org.testcontainers:postgresql")
    testImplementation("org.testcontainers:kafka")
    testImplementation("com.github.tomakehurst:wiremock-jre8")
    testImplementation("au.com.dius.pact.provider:junit5spring")
}
```

The platform BOM is updated quarterly. Security patches trigger out-of-band updates.

## ⚡ 8. Inner Loop Speed Targets

The inner loop is the cycle: **write code → compile → test → run**. Slow inner loops kill focus.

| Activity | Target |
|----------|--------|
| Clean build (no cache) | < 60 seconds |
| Incremental build | < 10 seconds |
| Unit test suite (single module) | < 30 seconds |
| Integration test suite | < 3 minutes |
| Hot reload (Java reference: Spring DevTools) | < 3 seconds |
| Application startup (local) | < 15 seconds |

If a service consistently misses these targets, the team must invest in improving build performance.

## 📏 9. Documentation Standards

### 9.1 What to Document

| Document | Location | Audience |
|----------|---------|---------|
| Service overview | `README.md` | All engineers |
| Local dev setup | `README.md#local-development` | New joiners |
| API reference | `api/openapi.yaml` → Backstage | API consumers |
| Architecture decisions | `docs/adr/` | Team + future engineers |
| Runbook | `docs/runbook.md` + Backstage | On-call engineers |
| Performance baseline | `docs/performance.md` | Platform + team |

### 9.2 README Standard

Every service README must contain:

```markdown
# Service Name

One sentence description of what this service does.

## Responsibilities
- What this service owns
- What it does NOT own

## Architecture
Brief description + link to architecture diagram

## Local Development
Prerequisites and steps to run locally (must work!)

## Configuration
Key configuration properties and where they come from

## API
Link to OpenAPI spec / Backstage API page

## Dependencies
- Upstream services this depends on
- Downstream services that depend on this

## On-call
Link to runbook and PagerDuty service
```

---

## 📈 10. Feedback & Platform Improvement

The platform exists to serve engineering teams. Teams should provide feedback via:
- **Monthly DX survey** - NPS-style, 3 questions, 2 minutes
- **#platform-feedback** Slack channel - for immediate issues
- **Backstage → Feedback** - for feature requests

Platform team SLA for responding to feedback: 2 business days.

---

## 🤝 11. Onboarding Buddy Program

Every new joiner is assigned an **onboarding buddy** from their team. The buddy is not the new joiner's manager.

### Buddy Responsibilities

| Period | Cadence | Activities |
|--------|---------|------------|
| Week 1 | Daily check-in | Orient to codebase, team rituals, tooling; answer questions; pair programming on first PR |
| Week 2 | 2-3 check-ins | First feature PR merged; attend sprint ceremonies (planning, standup, retro); complete security orientation (see [security-operations.md](../04-infrastructure-and-cloud/10-security-operations.md)) |
| Week 3 | Weekly check-in | On-call shadow - pair with primary on-call for one shift; domain deep-dive session with tech lead; attend architecture clinic |
| Week 4 | Weekly check-in | Solo on-call eligible (added to PagerDuty rotation); buddy graduation (feedback form submitted); 30-day check-in with engineering manager |

### Program Details

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Duration | 4 weeks |
| Selection | Rotating among team members |
| Engineering ladder | Counts toward the "mentoring" criterion |

### Feedback

At the end of the 4-week period:
- Both the new joiner and the buddy fill out a feedback form
- Results are reviewed by the engineering manager
- Aggregate feedback is used to improve the onboarding process quarterly

### 9.3 Document Quality

| Check | Frequency | Action on Failure |
|-------|-----------|-------------------|
| Broken link detection | Monthly CI job | Broken links filed as issues assigned to document owner |
| Staleness detection | Monthly scan | Docs not updated in > 6 months flagged for review by owner |

Any PR that changes **observable behavior** (API response format, configuration defaults, error handling, etc.) must update the relevant documentation. This is enforced via the PR template checklist:

```markdown
## PR Checklist
- [ ] If this PR changes observable behavior, I have updated the relevant documentation
```
